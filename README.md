# :heavy_exclamation_mark: This repository is now Obsolete!, use the [Pods alternative](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-Pods-DFU-Library) instead

## In order to be able to fully maintain quality of our products, this repository of our DFU Library is in the process of being deprecated, we recommend using the new one instead, [found here](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-Pods-DFU-Library) which fully supports the latest version of Xcode and Swift 3.0, easily integratable with Cocoapods or Carthage.

## We have decided to deprecate this library to avoid the confusion of having to juggle between two different versions of the library, and to streamline our products in a more controlled predictable manner.

### Thanks for your constant support, feedback and contributions that made this library happen.
